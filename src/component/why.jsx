        <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
        <p>
          Your BMI result gives you an idea of your weight relative to your
          height. A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a `&apos;`healthy weight`&apos;`. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.
          
          Remember, BMI is a basic measure and doesn`&apos;`t consider muscle and other
          factors. For personalized health advice, consult a professional.
